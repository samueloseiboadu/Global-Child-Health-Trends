Childhood malaria and diarrhoea remain pressing public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where they rank among the leading causes of mortality for children under five. This project harnesses the "Child Malaria and Diarrhoea Dataset," provided by UNICEF and spanning 1999 to 2024, to deliver actionable insights for policymakers and health organizations. By analyzing trends, identifying high-risk regions, and proposing evidence-based solutions, this work aims to support global efforts to reduce child mortality.

The content is organized as follows:
•	Background and Structure: Contextualizes the project and outlines its framework.

•	Data Structure and Overview: Describes the dataset’s composition and key features.

•	Executive Summary: Presents high-level findings and their implications.

•	Insight Deep Dive: Examines specific, data-driven insights.

•	Recommendations: Provides targeted strategies for decision-makers.


### Data Structure and Overview
The dataset encompasses 25 years (1999–2024) and includes the following key attributes:
•	Country: Nation of data collection.

•	Year: Year of record.

•	Malaria Cases: Number of reported malaria cases in children under five.

•	Diarrhoea Cases: Number of reported diarrhoea cases in children under five.

•	World Bank Income Group: Economic classification (e.g., Low, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, High).

•	UNICEF Programme Region: Geographical region per UNICEF’s framework.

•	UNICEF Reporting Region: Reporting region as defined by UNICEF.

•	Level: Administrative level of data (e.g., national or sub-national).

This dataset facilitates multidimensional analysis across time, geography, and economic contexts—offering a comprehensive tool for understanding disease patterns and informing strategic interventions.


### Executive Summary
Analysis of the dataset from 1999 to 2024 reveals critical trends in child malaria and diarrhoea:

•	Total Cases: Approximately 1.22 million cases, with malaria comprising 491,810 and diarrhoea 356,620.

•	Average Annual Cases: 37,710 cases per year, underscoring a persistent public health burden.

•	Regional Disparities: Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 65% of cases, highlighting significant geographical inequities.

•	Economic Correlation: Low-income countries exhibit markedly higher case rates, linking socioeconomic conditions to health outcomes.

These findings emphasize the ongoing need for targeted health interventions and resource allocation to combat child mortality due to malaria and diarrhoea, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions.


### Insight Deep Dive
The following insights, grounded in data, provide a foundation for strategic decision-making:

#### Insight 1: Regional Disease Burden

•	Finding: Sub-Saharan Africa represents ~65% of total cases, exceeding 793,000 over 25 years.

•	Significance: This region faces acute healthcare and resource challenges.

•	Trend: Case numbers remain elevated despite global efforts.

•	Implication: Enhanced, sustained interventions are essential to address this disparity.

#### Insight 2: Economic Status and Disease Prevalence

•  Finding: Lower-middle-income countries reported the highest incidence, with 240,500 malaria cases and 186,990 diarrhoea cases, followed by low-income countries with 218,780 malaria 
and 94,620 diarrhoea cases. 

•  Significance: Economic disadvantage drives higher disease prevalence, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of these countries are located. 

•  Trend: Over 25 years, lower-middle- and low-income countries consistently show higher case numbers. 

•  Implication: Economic development and region-specific interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa are critical to reduce this burden.

#### Insight 3: Malaria vs. Diarrhoea Distribution

•	Finding: Malaria accounts for 58% of cases, diarrhoea 42%.

•	Significance: Malaria poses a greater relative challenge in this dataset.

•	Trend: Malaria peaked in the early 2000s; diarrhoea declined post-2010.

•	Implication: Tailored strategies are needed, with a priority on malaria in certain contexts.

#### Insight 4: Temporal Trends

•	Finding: Annual cases dropped from over 60,000 in the early 2000s to ~30,000 by 2024.

•	Significance: This reduction reflects progress in health interventions.

•	Trend: The decline aligns with global disease control initiatives.

•	Implication: Ongoing investment can further diminish prevalence.

#### Insight 5: Treatment Coverage

•	Finding: Coverage rose from 40% in 1999 to 70% by 2024.

•	Significance: Improved access correlates with reduced cases.

•	Trend: Steady improvements reflect effective public health strategies.

•	Implication: Expanding coverage remains a priority for sustained impact.


### Recommendation

Based on the insights derived from the data analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1.	Target High-Burden Regions: 

*	Prioritize Sub-Saharan Africa with increased resources.

* Enhance healthcare infrastructure, train personnel, and distribute preventive tools (e.g., bed nets, sanitation kits).

2.	Support Economic Development: 

*	Strengthen health systems through economic growth in low-income countries.

*Invest in education, infrastructure, and employment opportunities.

3.	Enhance Disease Surveillance: 

o	Improve monitoring to enable rapid response.

* Deploy real-time outbreak tracking and regular health surveys.

4.	Prioritize Malaria Interventions: 

o	Address areas with high malaria prevalence.

* Expand access to antimalarials and insecticide-treated nets.

5.	Expand Treatment Access: 

o	Ensure comprehensive care for all affected children.

* Scale up health campaigns, fund treatment programs, and utilize technology for remote care.
