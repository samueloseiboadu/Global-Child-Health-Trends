Childhood malaria and diarrhoea remain pressing public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where they rank among the leading causes of mortality for children under five. This project harnesses the "Child Malaria and Diarrhoea Dataset," provided by UNICEF and spanning 1999 to 2024, to deliver actionable insights for policymakers and health organizations. By analyzing trends, identifying high-risk regions, and proposing evidence-based solutions, this work aims to support global efforts to reduce child mortality.

The content is organized as follows:
•	Background and Structure: Contextualizes the project and outlines its framework.

•	Data Structure and Overview: Describes the dataset’s composition and key features.

•	Executive Summary: Presents high-level findings and their implications.

•	Insight Deep Dive: Examines specific, data-driven insights.

•	Recommendations: Provides targeted strategies for decision-makers.


### Data Structure and Overview
The dataset encompasses 25 years (1999–2024) and includes the following key attributes:
•	Country: Nation of data collection.

•	Year: Year of record.

•	Malaria Cases: Number of reported malaria cases in children under five.

•	Diarrhoea Cases: Number of reported diarrhoea cases in children under five.

•	World Bank Income Group: Economic classification (e.g., Low, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, High).

•	UNICEF Programme Region: Geographical region per UNICEF’s framework.

•	UNICEF Reporting Region: Reporting region as defined by UNICEF.

•	Level: Administrative level of data (e.g., national or sub-national).

This dataset facilitates multidimensional analysis across time, geography, and economic contexts—offering a comprehensive tool for understanding disease patterns and informing strategic interventions.


### Executive Summary
Analysis of the dataset from 1999 to 2024 reveals critical trends in child malaria and diarrhoea:

•	Total Cases: Just over 411,000 reported cases, with malaria comprising 219,000 cases slightly more prevalent than diarrhoea 192,000.

•	Average Annual Cases: The average number of cases per year is around 16,000, a figure that has declined steadily over the last two decades.

•	Regional Disparities: : Most of the disease burden falls on Eastern and Southern Africa (ESARO), which recorded nearly 180,000 cases far more than any other region.

•	Economic Influence: Low-income and lower-middle-income countries account for the majority of all reported cases, showing how economic context continues to shape health outcomes.

•	Treatment Coverage: Access to treatment has improved over time, though coverage still lags, especially for malaria.

These findings emphasize the ongoing need for targeted health interventions and resource allocation to combat child mortality due to malaria and diarrhoea, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions.


### Insight Deep Dive
The following insights, grounded in data, provide a foundation for strategic decision-making:

#### Insight 1: Regional Disease Burden

•	Finding: The ESARO region—covering Eastern and Southern Africa—makes up the largest share of both malaria and diarrhoea cases, totaling around 180,000 over 25 years.

•	Why it Matters: This region consistently struggles with access to quality healthcare and resources, and the data clearly reflects that challenge.

•	Implication: Efforts to reduce child mortality should be prioritized in this region with tailored, long-term strategies.

#### Insight 2: Economic Status and Disease Prevalence

•  Finding: Lower-income countries reported the highest incidence, with 108,000 malaria cases and 46,000 diarrhoea cases, followed by lower-middle-income countries with 86,000 malaria 
and 92,000 diarrhoea cases. 

•  Why it Matters: Health outcomes remain closely tied to a country's economic status. Lower-income countries face more cases and often have weaker health systems.

•  Implication: Improving child health means not just treating disease—but also investing in the economies of affected countries.Economic development and region-specific interventions in such places are critical to reduce this burden.

#### Insight 3: Malaria vs. Diarrhoea Distribution

•	Finding: Malaria accounts for 58% of cases, diarrhoea 42%.

•	Significance: Both diseases are serious, but malaria appears to be the more dominant threat overall.

•	Trend: Malaria peaked in the early 2000s; diarrhoea declined post-2010.

•	Implication: While interventions must tackle both illnesses, malaria control should remain a high priority in policy and funding..


#### Insight 4: Treatment Coverage

•	Finding: Although treatment access has improved since 2000, malaria treatment coverage remains under 60% in most years. Diarrhoea treatment follows a similar trend..

•	Significance: Low coverage means many children still don’t receive timely care, leaving them vulnerable to health complications or death.

•	Implication: Expanding treatment programs especially in hard-to-reach communities must be a central part of the response.

### Recommendation

Based on the insights derived from the data analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1.	Target High-Burden Regions: 

-	Prioritize Sub-Saharan Africa with increased resources.

- Enhance healthcare infrastructure, train personnel, and distribute preventive tools (e.g., bed nets, sanitation kits).

2.	Support Economic Development: 

-	Strengthen health systems through economic growth in low-income countries.

- Invest in education, infrastructure, and employment opportunities.

3.	Enhance Disease Surveillance: 

-	Improve monitoring to enable rapid response.

- Deploy real-time outbreak tracking and regular health surveys.

4.	Prioritize Malaria Interventions: 

-	Address areas with high malaria prevalence.

- Expand access to antimalarials and insecticide-treated nets.

5.	Expand Treatment Access: 

-	Ensure comprehensive care for all affected children.

- Scale up health campaigns, fund treatment programs, and utilize technology for remote care.
